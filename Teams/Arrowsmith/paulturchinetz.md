##Who is the target audience for our application?
The target audience is people who like music. 

##What does our application do?
Our application works with soundcloud, twitter, and sentiment to assign a sentiment score to tweets, then plays songs from an appropriate playlist based on whether the tweet had a positive, negative, or neutral score. 

##How does our application do it?
The user will enter two tweets and the app will use geolocation to sense where the user is. We use node.js to run the server which will parse the tweets by two hashtags and distance from the user and assign a sentiment score to each tweet.
