Who is the target audience for our application?
	Mainly younger people interested in twitter and online image sharing.

What does our application do????

are given sentimental ratings. 5 along that range are chosen and displayed. Beside each tweet will
be a random picture from Flickr that also matches those hashtags.

How does our application do it?
	The files are stored on github, processed on cloud9, and deployed to Heroku. Twitter API asks
and pulls tweets from Twitter, and a Flickr API will pull the pictures.
